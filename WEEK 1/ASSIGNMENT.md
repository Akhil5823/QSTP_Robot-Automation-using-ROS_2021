# Week I: Unicycle
Kinematic models of robots approximate their behaviour given various control commands. For example, given a control command `(v, w)` i.e linear and angular velocity to a robot in a state `(x, y, theta)`, the robot behaviour after applying the command can be approximated using the kinematics model of a robot.

Unicycle model is the simplest there exists to approximate the behaviour of a differential drive Robot. Refer to [this](http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node660.html) resource to take a look at the equations in general

## Logistics
1. There is a python file accompanying this assignment. You have to complete some of the functions and plot the trajectory using `matplotlib`. [[Assignment](unicycle.py)].
2. Details regarding the submission, deadline etc. are updated in the Google Classroom.
